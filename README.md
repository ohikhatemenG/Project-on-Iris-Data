Project Overview
# Dataset
The Iris dataset is a multivariate set introduced by the British Statistician, Eugenicist and Biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements
in Taxonomic Problems, as an example of linear discriminant analysis, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the
other two are not linearly separable from each other.https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/Iris
